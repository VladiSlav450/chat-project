All contents of this directory is either copied from elsewhere, or
generated.  See the Common/ and Agenda/ dirs for details.

All files in the subdirectories, as well as the thalassa.ini file,
are supposed to be a part of the Agenda template implementation, so
perhaps you shouldn't edit them.  If you want to modify the template,
do so within the Common/ and Agenda/ directories.

Files that lay in the same directory with this WARNING file are intended
to be edited in order to custimize your site.  Refer to the README file
for instructions.

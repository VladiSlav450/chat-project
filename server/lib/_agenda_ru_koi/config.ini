# In most cases, the main page's file is named index.html, so it is
# usually safe to leave this untouched.  However, you can set it to
# whatever name you want; you can, e.g., generate your index.html file
# by adding a file named ``index'' to the db/pages directory, and use
# the ``mainpage'' generated by the template in any other role.
# If you don't want the default template's main page to be generated at
# all, set this parameter to ``-'' (a string of a single minus char).

# Please edit the following text to whatever you'd like to see on
# your site's main page.
# It is strongly recommended to use <h2>, <h3>, ... for your headings;

# Be sure to start every additional line with the ``+'' (or whitespace,
# but in this case remember that all leading whitespace will be trimmed
# off by thalassa).

[options site]

# Tags and attributes considered safe enough are specified in the
# base/base.ini; the following two options specify additional tags and
# attributes.  THESE ARE ONLY SAFE IN CASE ANONYMOUS COMMENTS ARE
# PREMODERATED AT YOUR SITE (and only people trusted to some level are
# permitted to bypass the premoderation).  As this is the default, and
# there's currently no user-modifiable option to change it (one has to
# edit the files within the base/ subdirectory), we leave these enabled
# by default.
#
# In case untrusted people have any chance to leave a comment at your site
# without premoderation, make the two parameters empty.  You've been
# warned.  Filtering of URLs in links is not yet implemented in Thalassa,
# so one may make some JavaScript into your comment pages usging the
# "URL schemes" named "javascript:" or "data:", and some injections are
# also possible through CSS specified in the ``style'' attribute.
# This isn't really a problem for premoderated sites though, as you (as
# the premoderator) will not let all that crap through.

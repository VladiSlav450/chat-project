title: Premoderation policy
format: texbreaks


This page is intended to explain principles, policies, rules and the like,
used to perform premoderation.  Unfortunately, the site's owner likely
paid no attention to this issue.

To change this page, please edit the file
<code>$site_source/db/pages/premod</code> and rebuild the static part of the
site, or even this single page (use
<code>thalassa&nbsp;gen&nbsp;-g&nbsp;'set=pages=premod'</code>).

If you don't want this page on your site, you can also delete the file.
Be sure to remove the hyperref to <code>premod.html</code> from the
guestbook page; its text is configured in the <code>srvtexts.ini</code>
file (see the <code>text_premod_note</code> parameter; you might want to
make it empty).

This <em>feed</em> (news/blog) item page is generated by Thalassa CMS using
one of the templates which come along with the CMS as an example.  The source
file for this page is

<pre>
  $site_source/db/pages/sample_news_1
</pre>

(where <code>$site_source</code> is the root directory for your site
source, initially created as a copy of the template of choice).
The source file contains the following header:

<pre>
  id: sample_news_1
  unixtime: 1689599565
  type: feed
  title: Sample news item #1 for the Thalassa templates
  format: texbreaks
  descr: Example of a feed (news/blog) item with a manually-written teaser
    (short description) for the digest
</pre>

The <code>descr</code> header field is one of the two ways to specify the
teaser for the <a href="/news.html">digest</a>.  For the second way, see
the <a href="sample_news_2.html">second news item sample</a>.

Please note the date displayed at the top of this page <stong>and</strong>
the navigation bar with large arrows.  These two elements are there because
the page has the &ldquo;<code>feed</code>&rdquo; type.  However, pages of
this type are not automatically included into the feed list; to do so, be
sure to add their names to the list in the &ldquo;<code>_feed</code>&rdquo;
file, which is found in the same directory with the source files (that's
it, the <code>$site_source/db/pages/</code> directory).  The IDs must be
placed one per line in that file.

format: texbreaks
teaser_len: 163


This <em>feed</em> (news/blog) item page is generated by Thalassa CMS using
one of the templates which come along with the CMS as an example.  The source
file for this page is

<pre>
  $site_source/db/pages/sample_news_1
</pre>

(where <code>$site_source</code> is the root directory for your site
source, initially created as a copy of the template of choice).
The source file contains the following header:

<pre>
  id: sample_news_2
  unixtime: 1689657570
  type: feed
  title: Sample news item #2 for Thalassa templates
  format: texbreaks
  teaser_len: 163
</pre>

&mdash; so the teaser (short description) included in the
<a href="/news.html">digest</a> is made as the first <em>N</em>
(163&nbsp;in this particular case) chars of the original text.

Please note the date displayed at the top of this page <stong>and</strong>
the navigation bar with large arrows.  These two elements are there because
the page has the &ldquo;<code>feed</code>&rdquo; type.  However, pages of
this type are not automatically included into the feed list; to do so, be
sure to add their names to the list in the &ldquo;<code>_feed</code>&rdquo;
file, which is found in the same directory with the source files (that's
it, the <code>$site_source/db/pages/</code> directory).  The IDs must be
placed one per line in that file.

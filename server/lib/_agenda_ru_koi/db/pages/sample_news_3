title: Sample news item #3 for Thalassa templates
format: texbreaks


This <em>feed</em> (news/blog) item page is generated by Thalassa CMS using
one of the templates which come along with the CMS as an example.  This
example shows a page included to a list, where the whole page text is used
as a &ldquo;digest&rdquo;.  To achieve this, both <code>descr</code> and
<code>teaser_len</code> fields are omitted from the header, so the header
is as follows:

<pre>
  id: sample_news_3
  unixtime: 1689679344
  type: feed
  title: Sample news item #3 for a Thalassa template
  format: texbreaks
</pre>

Please note this is a feature of the template; Thalassa itself assumes the
teaser is empty in this situation, but all sample templates use the page
body for the teaser in case the teaser is empty.

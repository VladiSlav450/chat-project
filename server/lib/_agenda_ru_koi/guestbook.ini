# When a lot of comments get added on your guestbook page, you might want
# to move it to the ``archive'' and make a new (and empty) guestbook page.
# This is done simply by adding more sections here; the last of them is
# automatically considered ``active''.  You also might want to change the
# titles for archive pages to reflect they are now archive.  Furthermore,
# you might (but not necessarily do) want to make older archive pages
# read-only.  Take a look at the following to get an idea of how all this
# mess might look like.

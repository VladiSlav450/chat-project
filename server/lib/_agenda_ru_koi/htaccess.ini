# It is safe in most cases to leave this ini file untouched.  By default,
# it instructs Thalassa to generate an ``.htaccess'' file within your
# site's root directory.  The file does the following:
#
#    - tells Apache to follow symbolic links should they are encountered
#      during search for a file to send to the client (this is needed for
#      Thalassa-style aliases to work; the Smoky template doesn't use the
#      aliasing feature, but Thalassa still has it);
#
#    - forbids disclosing of any files named ``thalcgi.ini'' (well, this
#      is not needed for suexec-based configurations as thalcgi.cgi refuses
#      to work until the permissions on its configuration file are set
#      to a safe value, but this task can't be solved with file
#      permissions for non-suexec setups, as the file must be readable for
#      the CGI itself, and when there's no suexec, the CGI runs with the
#      HTTP server's credentials);
#
#    - forces the trailing ``/'' to be added to URIs pointing to
#      directories (if this isn't done, you may sometimes get unpleasantly
#      surprized by how your local hyperrefs work);
#
#    - sets pages to be shown for the 403 (forbidden) and 404 (not found)
#      error conditions.
#
# However, all sites and setups are different, so you may want to make some
# changes here.  You can even decide to not generate the .htaccess at all,
# for example, if you prefer to set all the abovementioned things right in
# your Apache's configuration (which is, BTW, far better for the
# efficiency, as your Apache doesn't need to analyse the .htaccess on each
# and every request).
#
# To disable the .htaccess generation altogether, just comment out the rest
# of this ini file or even make it empty.
#
# Once again: IF UNSURE, LEAVE THIS FILE UNTOUCHED.
